## About me     

He graduated from the university with a degree in civil engineering. I worked for a couple of years, I realized that the construction is not mine.

Having analyzed my desires, opportunities, I understood my path to IT.
1. I love trying new things. Studying is not a burden for me
2. Everything related to technology and technological progress is interesting.
3. I have been wanting to learn English for a long time, but there was no understanding why and where to use it. IT solves this issue.
4. Persistent and patient. Struggling to solve the problem for many hours and not giving up is not a problem for me.
5. Reliable and punctual.
6. My weak side is communication skills. But I want to fix it.
7. I want to be free to move. Work at home or in the office, in my hometown or in another country, be able to manage my work schedule.

The profession in IT gives all of the above, that's why I'm here
